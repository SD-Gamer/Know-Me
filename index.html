            Bonjour people,
            Mai hu Soumya Dhandharia, <q>Naam toh suna he hoga</q>. 
            For those who don't know what it means, its a 
            dialogue by the legendary actor Shah Rukh Khan.
            Now if you were smart, by now you would have 
            got to know how movieholic I am, but that is
            just one of my hobby's, so now please wear
            your seat belts and be ready to go through the 
            roller-coaster of my diverse characteristics.

        <i><pre style="color: aliceblue; margin-left: -4%; font-size: 17px; margin-top: -2%;">
             So my name, Soumya, What does this name mean? It means an obedient, soft, loveable, good natured and an 
             innocent boy. I would be boasting if I said that i'm the exact person it is described as but I would also
             be lying if I denied about this. Yes, I am a loveable, soft guy but also with a pinch of anger, naughtiness
             and a jacked body. 

             I am a kaleidoscope of words and emotions, where only one or two words aren't enough to describe me. My
             mind is an art gallery where each though is a brustroke on the canvas of curiosity. 
            
             I have various sides and personalities to my character just like the Greek god Achilles, whose rage meant
             that he will help the Greeks in the battle on the other hand his rage meant immediate death for the Trojans.
             One side, of me, you have already seen which is being a movieholic. Now, I am also a sportsman, I am so connected
             to sports that I can't spend day without touching a basketball, but wait, I don't want to describe myself like
             this.

        <p><pre style="color: aliceblue; font-size: 17px; margin-top: -3%;">
        There are many things I like to do and I'm sure they are very different from others, par exemple, I like to
        do maths a lot like I can do maths at 3am but when I tell about that to others, their views are completely 
        opposite of mine and they would be ready to do everything except maths and to be honest I don't know why.
        So the here's the list of things that I like and why I like them:

        1. Basketball - It is like my passion and my heartbeat, I can't be proactive throughout the day if I haven't
                        played basketabll and that's probably because it helps me relieve stress and allows me to 
                        stop thinking about other things at that moment.

        2. Cultural Food - Yes, I am a foodie. I crave food, like, I want to try all new dishes, have a taste of 
                           all things. I enjoy tasting dishes very much and just like maths this is one of the 
                           things that I am ready to do at anytime, anywhere. Aren't you a foodie also?

        3. Study - Studying is one of the things that helps me improve my focus and prepare my mind to think out
                   of the box. I know many people hate studying but what can I do, I don't have control over things
                   that I enjoy doing. But I think that this is good because when studying is the only thing which
                   doesn't have any side-effects.
        
        4. Art and craft - I like to draw things and colour them from various ways like glass painting, knife painting,
                           etc., I also love crafting new things in orgimai and sometimes on my own also because of 
                           my innovative instinct. But all in one, art and craft is very soothing for me and I love it.
